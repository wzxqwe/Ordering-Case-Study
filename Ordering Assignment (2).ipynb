For simplicity, we can model the truck has having a known max volume capacity, and the sum of the volumes of the parts in the truck has to be less than this capacity. (Obviously this is a simplification, in reality fitting the most number of boxes in a truck is a more complex problem)\n",

    "    Here we assume all parts and trucks are different, I.e. for different parts, the quantity in a box and volume of the box are different and for a truck, the cost and capacity of truck can vary. Such kinds of assumption could reflect complex real business cases but would require a longer computing time for optimal. Because basically the solver would have to run for all the combination of box-truck allocation.\n",

    "    However, if we assume all parts are shifted in the same size box with same quantity, and all trucks in the market are identical in capacity and cost, we can quickly reduce model complexity. But such kinds of naive assumption may fail to model reality.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    We notice there are two optmizing component in the problem: to minimize truck's cost and minimize inventory cost. Tradeoff here would be: if the truck cost is relatively high, our model would tent to use truck's capacity as much as possible, and allow a larger inventory; take a extreme case as an example, if we don't have a inventory cost, the model would useup all capacity and allow inventory for multiple following days.\n",

    "##### 3. Parameter's effect\n",
    "\n",
    "    Number of parts, number of different trucks, number of different boxes are some important parameters in our problem. While it's generally hard to measure the complexity of a MIP, more variables usually make the problem harder to solve. For example, if we are using a branch and cut algorithm, we would have to do a N choose K hyperplane cut to tight the linear relaxiation, which would quickly increase solving time as N becomes larger. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Other parameters like Quantity of boxes, Volume of boxes, cost of truck, capacity of truck would also affect optimal solution. For example, if all boxes are relatively large for the truck, it would be hard to squeeze many boxes into one truck, thus our optimal solution will inevitablly have many trucks that have extra unused capacity, and we cannot find any box to fit in. While on the other hand, if there exist some boxes that are relatively small, we would be more efficient in using up truck capacity and thus reduce total truck cost. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Different kinds of scenarials could happen in reality, and we can take a further step after computing a optimal solution. For example, if we find our optmal solution indeed has a lot of unused capacity in trucks, we could propose to shift parts in some smaller boxes and smaller quantities, which might help to reduce overall cost. (essntially this is we are trying to relax some constriants to get a better objective value)"
